# NerdyGraduationCard

Welcome Nerds and Happy Graduation!  You are probably visiting this page because some awesome person gave you a Nerdy Graduation Card :) 
Use the switch to turn on your Nerdy Graduation Card.  It will display "Happy Graduation!" (or a custom message if ordered) and play a song (Pomp and Circumstance).  After the song is complete, the display will test your success using the "Success-O-Meter."  Hold down the button until it tells you to stop.  Finally, the display says "You Did It!" (or custom message)  You can also write the name of the special person on the back as well as the date.  A fine tip sharpie marker works best.  

Please review the instructions for inserting the battery.  

SECRET VIDEO GAME IS REVEALED AFTER FINAL SCREEN OR ACTIVATED BY HOLDING DOWN THE BUTTON WHILE POWERING ON!  

## YouTube Demonstration: TBD
